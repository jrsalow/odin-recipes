# odin-recipes

My first Odin Project, project. I have a lot of previous experience, but I've chosen to for-the-most-part go through everything as if a beginner. So far we have covered basic HTML boilerplate, anchors (such as links), inline images.

This project will be a basic recipe website, including a main index page with links to recipes.
